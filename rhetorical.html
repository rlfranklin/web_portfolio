	<h1>The Poetry in Their Web Design</h1>
	<p align="left">Sarah Kay is the&nbsp;founder and co-director of Project V.O.I.C.E, a movement to inspire others via spoken word. Richard Blanco is a Latino poet who read at Barack Obama&rsquo;s second inauguration and whose poems have been featured in many literary journals. Sarah Kay&rsquo;s and Richard Blanco&rsquo;s website tell a little bit about themselves, their accomplishments, and their work. One can discover  when they are having an event, how to contact them,  and where to find their work online or become a part of their social media circle. &nbsp;However, in terms of web design, by appearance alone, Kay&rsquo;s website seems to blow Blanco&rsquo;s out of the water. Her homepage is a simple illustration and a good amount of white space blended in the entire page. Blanco&rsquo;s homepage on the other hand has multiple images, plenty of links, and good chunk of content telling users about himself and the purpose of the website. Though these two poets share similar interest in writing, there is a stark different in their websites. </p>

	<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
	<h2 align="left">On Headers </h2>
	<p align="left">The header is usually the first thing one sees when visiting a webpage. Blanco includes a quote in his header to show who he is as writer. He also uses a background image and a stylized serif font for his name. With black as the fill and red as the stroke, Richard attempts to make his name to stand out.&nbsp; While the red and black work well with the overall color scheme, it is questionable whether or not it works with the background image. Perhaps if the image were much lighter or had a lower opacity, his name would stand out more. Instead the eye is drawn towards the busy background, especially if one is trying to discover what it is composed of. </p>
	<p align="center"><br />

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Kay&rsquo;s heading, on the other hand,  blends in with the rest of the website since the homepage is a picture. She&rsquo;s uses a simple black/ dark grey sans-serif font  and  captial letters. The main focus in on her name since there is nothing on the background except a smooth textured grey background. There is some writing on the side, but since it&rsquo;s a smaller font and a lighter color, the eye is drawn to her name first. While Blanco has a nice color scheme going on in his header, Kay&rsquo;s use of white space and simplicity makes her header more effective. </p>
	<p align="center"><img src="rhetorical/images/kay header.png" width="757" height="111" alt="kay's header" /></p>
	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
	<h2 align="left">On Navigation</h2>
	<p>These poets also have a very different way of having visitors navigate  their website. Blanco uses a sidebar and center aligns his links. When visitors scroll down to read the rest of the content, the sidebar continues down the page, but the links remain at the top, so one must scroll back up if they wish to visit another page. When one hovers over a link, the color changes to black as well as the picture up on the top the side bar. To show the user what page they are on, the link remains black. The navigation on this website is simple and the user should not have much trouble when it comes to finding what they want and need.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="rhetorical/images/blanco sidebar.png" width="115" height="413" alt="blanco's links" /></p>
	<p>Kay takes on a more aesthetic approach for her navigation. When one enters her website, one sees an illustration of a brick wall and various objects. It is very simple and when one hovers the mouse over these various objects, links appear. Once you click on one of the links, it opens up to that particular webpage and the rest of the navigation links are rested horizontally on top of the page. Like Blanco&rsquo;s site, one can see where they are once they click on a link and enter that particular webpage. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="rhetorical/images/kay links better.png" width="664" height="150" alt="kay's links" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>While the illustration is very pretty, it is not obvious what the website is about, where to find the links- one may not realize that they must interact with the image- and what the links are. The only link that seemed to have decent correlation is &ldquo;About Me,&rdquo; which appears when one hovers over her name. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s visually appeasing to hover over them lamppost and see it light up, it is not intuitive that the link leads to &ldquo;video,&rdquo; or the umbrella is leads to &ldquo;other projects.&rdquo; One also does not initially know where to begin because they don&rsquo;t know what to look for. By entering her homepage, they don&rsquo;t who she is or what she does. They only get a vague idea when hovering over the different objects. Because of this, Blanco&rsquo;s navigation is more successful. One can clearly see what&rsquo;s going one and what is offered on the website. Based on the links alone, users can see who Blanco is and what the website is about. People may mistake Kay for an illustrator based on her homepage alone. Kay&rsquo;s navigation process becomes as effective as Blanco&rsquo;s once one clicks a link and enters a new webpage.<br />

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>On Layout</h2>
	<p>Blanco decided to use a three column design for his website. In one column, he has a sidebar with the navigation links for the entire site. His text is in the middle and he has another sidebar with miscellaneous links on the last side. Once one reaches the end of the text, the three columns appears to be broken since he displays his poetry books, and small social media icons. There is also a clear separation from the main body of the website and his footer. Unfortunately, this does not give the site a sense of uniformity and it can make the webpage appear crowded. Blanco has the chance to do this when he finishes telling users about himself, but he lists poetry books he&rsquo;s published instead. He also displays where one can find him on the Internet. Lastly, his footer has a very different color scheme and actually is very large due to having a various amount of information; such as the amount of visitors the site has had since it&rsquo;s launched. Based on the bottom of the website, especially the image next to the search bar, Blanco does not want  too much white space which may have helped his website. </p>
	<p align="center"><img src="rhetorical/images/blanco poetry books.png" width="492" height="164" alt="blanco's books" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="rhetorical/images/blanco footer.png" width="353" height="169" alt="footer" /></p>
	<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="left">Kay's use of columns vary throughout her website. On some web pages, she uses two columns and on others she uses three. Despite  using different amounts of columns, there is still a good amount of white space within the webpage and it does not look crowded. These columns usually have pictures with text underneath them. The footer is just a couple links on the bottom of the website and it has a  neat appearance. Kay&rsquo;s website never breaks the illusion to the amount of columns she has on her webpage and she does not shy away from white space. If anything she embraces it and because of that, her website is clean, crisp, and beautiful.</p>

	<h2 align="left">On Conclusions<br />
	</h2>
	<p>While Sarah Kay has an appealing website, in terms of practicality and function, Richard Blanco&rsquo;s site serves it&rsquo;s purpose. These two poets are from different walks of life and have different journeys. Blanco showcases his achievements and where one can find him online. Kay shares what&rsquo;s she interested in and what she has done. She takes a more experimental and artistic approach to her website and that in turn shows visitors who she is as an artist. Though one may have to exert more effort into finding more about Kay, one cannot deny that her sense of style and design  is a form of poem. </p>
