<h2 id="what-is-email">What is an Email</h2>
<p>Email, short for "electronic mail," is a digital message online users send to each other. To send and receive these messages, you'll need an email address, which is your electronic mailbox where messages are delivered, and an internet connection. When you create your email address, an email service provider like Gmail will assign it to you if it’s available. All email addresses must be unique. You’ll also need an email address for your recipient. In this guide, we'll use <a href="mailto:SampleEmailAddress@gmail.com">SampleEmailAddress@gmail.com</a> as our example.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To access Gmail and create a new email, you'll need to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup" target="_blank">sign up for a Google Account</a>.</p>

<h2 id="email-delivery">Email Delivery and Retraction Window</h2>
<p>When you click <b>Send</b>, Gmail offers you five seconds to retract your message before your email will be delivered. Be sure to include all the relevant information, proofread your text, and check that you’re sending your email to the right address. Once your email is delivered, there’s no taking it back. If you forgot to add any information to your initial message, you’ll have to send a follow-up email.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-email">Scheduling Your Email</h2>
