  <h2 align="left">Hell Hath No Furry</h2>
<p align="left">Let's just say that, my husband Mikey and I were a little below middle class. Our conversations always seemed to be about money. It drove me crazy, but I listened to his lavish dreams. All this talk of money and visions for the future led me to believe that he wasn't happy with me, and he looked for something else to fulfill this empty spot. I never brought it up because I wanted trust him.</p>
<p align="left">Anyways, I decided to drive to the park one day to join him on his daily jog. There, I found a woman in a coat that appeared to cost more than my bi-weekly paycheck who had her small hands all over my man. I watched my husband bestow this woman with a smile meant for me, and me alone, then kiss her. He never saw me. I returned to my car in the parking lot trying to process what I just witnessed.</p><p align="left">When Mikey and his sugar mama finally approach the parking lot, he recognized our car. I relished seeing his cocky attitude vanish in his fear. My foot jerked and slammed on the gas as his mistress pulls him in the street towards her Lamborghini. Fortunately, I had a seatbelt on because boy was that a bumpy ride.</p>

<div id="imperfection">
  <h2 align="left">Imperfection </h2>
<p align="left"><br />
  “Play it again,” Arata croaked. </p>
  <p align="left">Yolandi’s frail arms hung down her side. </p>
<p align="left">“I want to go home.” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“I said play it again.” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">He could tell by the black paint caked around her eyes and those hideous dark nails that she would be out in the streets instead of going home. Yolandi sniffed, raised the viola to her shoulder, and started to play Mozart’s 40th symphony. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Stand up straight,” Arata called. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Just fourteen years old and yet he could smell the smoke off her clothes. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Start again!” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Yolandi stomped one foot. Arata stared at her fingers. She was letting her nails grow. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Cut your nails and wipe that paint off them,” he growled. “Now!”<br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Yolandi rolled her eyes, dropped the viola and bow on the sofa, and sauntered off. Arata took a deep breath debating whether or not to scold her on her way out, or wait for her to come back. He stared at the shiny instrument and a photograph on the table drew his eye. He saw a young woman with long hair and glasses stare back at him with a small smile. Arata tightened up, walked over to the photograph, and placed it facedown. He was in the middle of a lesson. He could ponder on it later. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Yolandi came back from the bathroom. Her nails were still painted. She glared at Arata and pulled her loose pants up. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“I have a lot of work to do,” she spoke. “I’m going home.” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Your concert is in two weeks and you’re unprepared,” Arata mumbled. “Play it for me once with no mistakes and then you can go.” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Yolandi nods and starts to play again. Arata takes a deep breath. She would meet with boys. There was nothing kids hid in this town. They could be seen kissing and necking on the streets, smoking and cursing in the stores, laughing and fooling around after school. He won’t let Yolandi become like that. She may not be his daughter, but he can see his daughter in her, the daughter he was supposed to have before her mother, that whore…<br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“You’re flat,” Arata calls. “Play it again. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“I’m tired!” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“I said play it again!” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">As she started to play, Arata closed his eyes. He listened to the music and in between the squeaks and flat notes, he could hear her anger in the piece. It resonated with his own as he thought of how his daughter will not be raised properly. She was living with a woman who turned to the comforts of the bottle, a woman who did not care what people think or what her daughter does. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Start over!” he shouted. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">The music sounded awful. She was still flat. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Again!” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">The music stopped. <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">“Start over!” <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">Yolandi threw the viola to ground. She pulled her pants up, grabbed her backpack, and stormed out the house. Arata stared at the broken bridge and cracks along the side. His daughter broke her cello too.</p>

<div id="overconfident">
<h2 align="left">Overconfident </h2>
<p align="left">“Why don’t you FILL me up, FILL me a BUTTER CUP, Myra oh  don’t let me down, let me down, cause when I turn around I-”<br />
<p align="left">“You sound…” Myra paused to try to come up with the perfect word. “…appalling.”
  </p>
<p align="left">Wayne gripped the steering wheel then turned up the volume.</p>
<p align="left">“Truth hurts, Wayne.” Myra exclaimed. “Someone was bound to tell you.”</p>
<p align="left">“Yeah well, you’re the only one who would describe my awesome singing as “appalling.”  I think your just mad that you can’t sing as good as me.” </p>
<p align="left">“As well as.”</p>
<p align="left">“Excuse my grammar Ms. Brooks.”</p>
<p align="left">“Well,” she began, “if I’m going to be a successful English teacher, I have to start working on my grammar and correct everyone else’s.”</p>
<p align="left">“Well, then I order you to stop correcting my grammar.”</p>
<p align="left"> Myra glared at Wayne, but didn’t say anything. She pulled down her black maid skirt to cover up more of her exposed thighs. Wayne noticed and laughed once he saw her expression. He reached over and gave her a gentle shake on the shoulder.</p>
  
<p align="left">“Come on, no one would really know,” he smiled. “It’s Halloween and I’m sure the guys didn't tell anybody.” </p>
<p align="left"> “I’m pretty sure they did.” Myra scowled. “Can you please just drop me off somewhere? I’d rather go trick-or-treating than show up to a party like this.”</p>
<p align="left"> “No, you’re supposed to be my maid and do whatever I say and I want us to attend the party.  James is going to get a kick out of this.”</p>
<p align="left"> Myra groaned. She stared out the window  to observe the yellow, orange and the occasional red tree they drove past as they headed over towards a friends’ house. She glanced at Wayne once more before she began to devise ways to get out of the embarrassing situation. She wanted nothing more than to just leave the car and be somewhere else. She gave up trying to convince him why she couldn’t show up at the party. What he a thickheaded guy. His answer was always final. </p>
<p align="left">The bet was a horrible idea, so demeaning and insulting. However, she was so sure that she could win and the thought of Wayne being her maid cracked her up. So she agreed. Whoever crossed the finish line last was to be a maid for three days. She was so close. <br />
